# Animexperience

Automatized high level scrapper of an anime page (https://www3.animeflv.net/) to provide a better user experience based on the retrieved data.

With low level interception in video players such as MEGA, OK.RU and more that makes their features controllable and overridable.

In technical aspects this is also: an Electron application with React and TypeScript

Note: This project is for personal use only and a proof of my knowledge in this area.
